# 30 Days CodeCamp - Learning Journey

## Introduction

Welcome to my 30 Days CodeCamp with CodeMarch! In this camp, I'm thrilled to share my learning journey, where I'm exploring HTML, CSS, Git, and Tailwind CSS. This repository serves as a showcase of my progress and the skills I've acquired during this exciting coding adventure.

## What to Expect

Over the course of 30 days, I've been diving into the fundamentals of web development. Here's what I've been learning:

1. **HTML:** I've grasped the core concepts of HTML, understanding how to create the structure of web pages and organize content effectively.

3. **Git:** I've mastered Git, a powerful version control system that allows me to track changes in my code and collaborate with others seamlessly.

4. **Tailwind CSS:** I've explored Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, which has helped me streamline my development workflow and create responsive designs effortlessly.
