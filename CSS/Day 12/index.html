    <p>In my CSS units assignment, I explored the different units available in CSS, including pixels, percentages, EM
        units, and viewport units. I learned how to apply these units to create flexible and responsive designs.</p>
    <p>By using relative units like EM and percentages, I can adjust sizes and dimensions based on the parent element or
        viewport. This enables me to develop layouts that adapt well to various screen sizes and devices.</p>
